# sdLog
Convert SkyDemon's flightlog summary to a CSV list.

SkyDemons ability to generate flightlog entries that resemble those used in standard hardcopy logbooks is very limited. The most annoying shortcomings are that the log summary lists airports by their names, which are not standardized, instead of ICAO codes. Moreover each entry of the log summary list contains items (tokens) which are separated by whitespace, making it cumbersome to distinguish between e.g. a blank separating two parts of an airport name (as in Mannheim City) and a whitespace separating ther airport's name and the airplane's name. sdLog tries to convert SkyDemons log summary to a list of csv-items, resembling entries in a standard logbook.

This whole projected will be obsoleted once the the feature request for SkyDemon gets implemented http://forums.skydemon.aero/Topic27999.aspx Please vote for it ;-)
